        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            <em>Mama mia</em>. I'm not Italian, but I love-a a good-a pizza (that's not cultural appropriation, right? I'm just parodying a popular video game franchise... right?). Arguably my favorite food since I was a kid, pizza is something I hope to be able to enjoy until the day I die. Sure, my tastes have matured—along with my cholesterol levels—but I will always have a special place in my heart for pizza. Figuratively speaking.

            One of my fondest memories as a kid is "delivering" pizza to my family after my grandpa took me to go pick it up. Another one of my fondest memories is making homemade pizza with my grandma. Sometimes it's ideal to order in a pizza, sometimes heating up a frozen one is the answer. But if you've never made your own pizza, it's definitely something you should try at least once!

            The hardest part of making homemade pizza is making the dough, but we will get into that with another recipe. For now, enjoy <strong>Easy Pizza Sauce</strong> as a quick and convenient way to put together a delicious and authentic-tasting pizza sauce. This is another recipe I found online, where <a href="https://joyfoodsunshine.com/easy-homemade-pizza-sauce-recipe/" rel="noreferrer">the author</a> claims to have developed it from her experience working in a Chicago pizzeria. I haven't made any alterations—she got it 100% right as far as I can taste. Thanks Laura!
