        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            If you love asian take-out, this recipe is for you! <strong>Chinese Orange Chicken</strong> is a recipe I found online that is "way better than take-out"—according to the <a href="https://www.modernhoney.com/chinese-orange-chicken/" rel="noreferrer">original author</a>. My girlfriend and I love this recipe—and we can confirm that it <em>is</em> a cost-effective and tasty replacement for take-out. The quality will probably be better than—or at least on par with—most chinese take-out (at least in the midwestern US). Waay better than the frozen grocery store option.</p>
         <p>
            This recipe was already pretty great, but I've adjusted a few minor things, including the cornstarch/water ratio. The chicken does take a bit of preparation, but otherwise this dish pretty straightforward to make. If you have a rice cooker, it's even easier! If you don't already have a rice cooker, do yourself a favor and go buy one. Seriously.

         <h3>Steps</h3>
         <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>To begin cooking rice:</strong>
            </li>
            <li>
                Rinse rice 4-7 times, or until water starts to run more clear.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add rice and 4 cups water to rice cooker. Begin cooking on regular "white rice" setting.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>To make orange sauce:</strong>
            </li>
            <li>
                In a medium pot, add orange juice, sugar, vinegar, soy sauce, ginger, garlic, and red chili flakes. Heat for 3 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                In a small bowl, whisk 2 Tablespoons of cornstarch with 2 Tablespoons of water to form a paste. Add to orange sauce and whisk together. Continue to cook for 5 minutes, until the mixture begins to thicken. Once the sauce is thickened, remove from heat and add orange zest. Save some orange zest for garnish, if desired.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>To make chicken:</strong>
            </li>
            <li>
                Place flour and cornstarch in a shallow dish or pie plate. Add a generous pinch of MSG/salt. Stir.
            </li>
            <li>
                Whisk eggs in shallow dish.
            </li>
            <li>
                Dip chicken pieces in flour mixture, then in egg mixture, and then again in flour mixture. Place on plate.
            </li>
            <li>
                Heat 2 -3 inches of oil in a heavy-bottomed pot over medium-high heat. Using a thermometer, watch for it to reach 350 degrees.
            </li>
            <li>
                Working in batches, cook several chicken pieces at a time. Cook for 2 - 3 minutes, turning often until golden brown. Place chicken on a paper-towel-lined plate. Repeat (yes, you need to fry the chicken twice). Be careful to watch the time carefully and avoid overcooking.
            </li>
            <li>
                Toss chicken with orange sauce. Reserve some of the sauce to place on the rice, if desired.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>To bring it all together and serve:</strong>
            </li>
            <li>
                Serve chicken on rice with a sprinkling of green onion and orange zest, if desired. I like to put some extra red chili flakes on mine as well. Enjoy!
