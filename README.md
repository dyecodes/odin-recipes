# odin-recipes

This objective of this project is to create a basic website that showcases three recipes. The site should have four pages, including the index page. Each recipe should have its own page and each recipe page should have the same formatting structure.

This project demonstrates the following HTML and Git skills:
 - Create HTML boilerplate, or basic structure, for web pages
 - Use anchor elements to create links to absolute and relative web pages
 - Use image elements to showcase images using appropriate alternate (alt) text
 - Format webpage content with the header, paragraph, strong, and emphasis elements
 - Create ordered and unordered lists
 - Use Git to stage and commit changes to local repositories
 - Use Git to push local repository changes to GitHub
 - Write effective and helpful commit messages using the Conventional Commits specification
 - Use proper indentation to make nesting clear and readable
 - Use comments as necessary to provide context in HTML code
 - Use the "noreferrer" relation attribute in an anchor element to prevent the opened webpage from knowing which resource referenced it (this attribute contains "noopener" functionality as well, which prevents the opened webpage from gaining access to the host webpage)
